        OK, I've created a new solitaire game.  As with any good solitaire game, it's difficult to win.  At times seemingly impossibly difficult.  

        So... Let's simulate a few dozen/thousand/million card games and see how it really plays out. 
        <br>
        <input id="level" type="number" max="6" min="1" value="1" title="Level" >
        Level
        <br>
        <input id="iterations" type="number"  min="1" value="100" title="Number of Simulations to Run" >
        Number of Simulations to Run
        <br>
        
        <input id="runsim" type="button" value="Run simulation(s)">

    </p>
    <p id="output"></p>
